You can create your own resume or introduction page with layout 'page'.

The page section should have 3 front-matter keys.

<span class="highlight_crimson">layout: it should be as 'page'</span>
<span class="highlight_green">title:  title of page. for example, 'Welcome to My Blog'</span>
<span class="highlight_yellow">permalink: URL for this page.</span>

In Page, you are not able to use ruby's 'highlight' filter. Instead that, use span with class="hightlight_{color}".
Please refer to the css file at /assets/css/highlight.css
